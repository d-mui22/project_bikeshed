**List of Features**

Our site features an index of available reviews of Harley Davidson Motorcycles. Each review on the index page links to a review page which contains;

  - reviews, manufacturer's specs and photo images

  - comments on the posted reviews

  - a form to allow the user to add comments

From the index page a user can navigate to a form to submit a review. The form will capture;

  - Bike Year, Bike Model Name, and a description(review body)

  - an optional field to enter the manufacturer's Bike Code

Users can edit and delete any reviews they have posted, but not reviews that other users have posted.

We hope to integrate an API so that a user can click a link that will take them to eBay Motors to see a list of available bikes for purchase that match the bike reviewed.
